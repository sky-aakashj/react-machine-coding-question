# 3x3 Grid Activation (React Project)

This React project builds a dynamic 3x3 grid where users can click and activate individual cells, turning them green. Once all cells are activated, a unique twist occurs: clicking any cell triggers a deactivation sequence, reversing the activation order and visually deactivating cells one by one.

## Features

* Interactive 3x3 grid with clickable cells.
* Clicks activate cells, changing their color to green.
* Deactivation sequence in reverse order upon full activation.
* Built entirely with React and JavaScript.
